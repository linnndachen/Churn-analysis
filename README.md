### Project Motivation and Overview
This is the project for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree - project 1. This was a dataset I found on Kaggle a while ago and I did it as a self-interst project. The original analysis and dataset can be found on ___ In this folder, I changed the analysis a bit for better fit the requirment of Udacity. 

### Installation: 
There are two types of files.
- Option 1: HTML format. You can download the file and open the file on your browser after you download it. This method does not require any additional installation. 
- Option 2: Jupyter Notebook format. To run the code properly you need to run it using Python versions 3.0 or superior. In addition you need to import the following libraries for importing, manipulating and plotting data:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
os
datetime
statistics

### File Descriptions:
Inside the project 1 folder, there are 4 files:
- CSV file: the database I downloaded from Kaggle
- two ipynb files: they are the analysis in the forms of jupyter notebook
- 1 html file: the file that does not need any requirment to open

### Results
The analysis and findings can be find in the post available here

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
My acknowledgements to Kaggle for the good quality and clean data, without these analysis could not be done.

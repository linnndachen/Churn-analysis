### Project Motivation and Overview
This is the project for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree - project 1. This was a dataset I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/barun2104/telecom-churn) a while ago and I did it as a self-interst project. I changed the analysis a bit to fit the requirement of Udacity better. In this project, I aim to answer three business questions:

1. What is the value of my model to this telecom company?
2. What types of customers are most likely to churn and why?
3. What can we do about it?

### Installation: 
There are two types of files.
- Option 1: HTML format. You can download the file and open the file on your browser after you download it. This method does not require any additional installation. 
- Option 2: Jupyter Notebook format. To run the code properly you need to run it using Python versions 3.0 or superior. In addition you need to import the following libraries for importing, manipulating and plotting data:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
os
datetime
statistics

### File Descriptions:
Inside the project 1 folder, there are 4 files:
- CSV file: the database I downloaded from Kaggle
- two ipynb files: they are the analysis in the forms of jupyter notebook
- 1 html file: the file that does not need any requirment to open

### Results
The analysis and findings can be find in the post available [here](https://medium.com/@lindachen_/churn-analysis-why-is-it-valuable-2dae64fd45f8?source=friends_link&sk=51bb392caa613c79fa7b8e3ee73d63a0)

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
My acknowledgements to Kaggle for the good quality and clean data, without these analysis could not be done. The original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/barun2104/telecom-churn)
